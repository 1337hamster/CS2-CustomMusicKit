# Getting Started
1. [Download the latest release](https://github.com/KingHabib/CS-Jukebox/releases/download/v1.0/CS.Jukebox.v1.0.zip) (Windows only).
2. Extract the folder inside the zip.
3. Launch CS-Jukebox.exe
4. Jukebox will ask you to locate the root folder for CS:GO. This is the folder containing csgo.exe
5. If CS:GO is open, it must be restarted for Jukebox to work.

# How to create kits
Creating a music kit can be easily done inside CS-Jukebox
1. Click the "Add" button on the main screen.
2. Create a name for the music kit.
3. For each song, click browse to navigate to a song downloaded on your computer.
4. Adjust any controls such as Volume or Start Position.
5. Click Save and enjoy your music kit.

# How it works
CS-Jukebox works by using CS:GO's official <a href="https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Counter-Strike:_Global_Offensive_Game_State_Integration">GameState Integration</a>
to read data from the game such as round phases, bomb states, and teams. This method is safe and will not cause any VAC bans.
